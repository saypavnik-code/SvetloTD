# Development roadmap (2026-10 baseline)

Legend: [x] implementation in this patch; [ ] planned / not verified in a browser.

## P0 - correctness / playable baseline

- [x] Symmetric 18x18 four-lane map and routes ending at exact shared center.
- [x] Projectile release, visible splash lifetime and pool double-release guard.
- [x] Correct high-speed travel across multiple enemy waypoints.
- [x] Scene shutdown hook and scoped event cleanup.
- [x] Difficulty multipliers wired into enemy HP and speed.
- [x] 40-wave data declarations with provisional acts 5-8.
- [x] Runtime-loadable deterministic terrain textures and 12 optional prototype sprite PNGs.
- [ ] Browser smoke run: 1-40, victory/defeat, pause/resume, restart, targeting.
- [ ] Record baseline bugs and fix after first game session.

## P1 - product/quality gate

- [ ] Replace legacy Phaser type shim with official package declarations.
- [ ] Add proper unit/integration tests (wave completions, no double reward, skill cooldowns).
- [ ] Playtest and numerically rebalance levels 21-40 and all difficulty presets.
- [ ] Add structured save schema, migration, replay seeds, crash reporting (consent-aware).
- [ ] Compare unique mobile/meta modules under `SvetloTD-live/`; migrate or archive safely.
- [ ] Implement explicit ownership of EventBus subscriptions in every scene/UI component.
- [ ] Usability pass: gamefield vs 560px panel, pause, keyboard, mobile and safe areas.

## P2 - game design / visual production

- [ ] Tower schools and counters; at least three viable strategies for waves 10/20/30/40.
- [ ] Art bible: silhouette language, scale, palette, contrast and animations.
- [ ] Replace prototypes with authored 2D sprite atlases, 2-4 animation states each.
- [ ] SFX mixing/ducking, captions, color-blind modes, reduced-motion option.
- [ ] Hero depth and active abilities; wave modifiers with comprehensible telegraphs.

## P3 - multiplayer and release

- [ ] Design authoritative server simulation, reconnect and deterministic replays.
- [ ] Coop 2-4 players with lane roles and fair player-count scaling.
- [ ] Platform adapter only after target-specific VK SDK agreement.
- [ ] GitHub Pages beta, then validated VK Play HTML5 onboarding.
- [ ] Vibe deploy after owner verifies account entitlement and authenticated /v1/me.
- [ ] FPS/memory/network/load tests and 40-wave completion telemetry.

## Release gate

No public '40 levels balanced', '4-player multiplayer', or 'VK published' claims
until the corresponding tasks are tested and accepted.
